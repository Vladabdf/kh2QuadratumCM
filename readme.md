## Replaces KH1 Command Menu

> ### This is the standard version.
> > ### This means this version of the mod supports resolutions between 720p ~ 1080p. If you play on a resolution higher than 1200p (E.g. 2560x1440, or 3840x2160), you might be interested in using the [UHD version here.](https://github.com/Vladabdf/kh2QuadratumCM-UHD)

The majority of assets used in this mod are strictly made by me to imitate the look and feel of Quadratum without outright changing how the menu works. I may make a version later to make it lay out on the screen more akin to its appearance in KH3.

Maybe...
